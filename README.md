A simple parametric pride flag rainbow pin generator.

It allows you to generate pins with the colors of the pride flag of your choice and the pins are 
designed to be printed with any single filament printer.

#### Usage

You can just run `make` to generate a default set of STL files for a number of pride flags.

If your particular flag is not on the list, ypu can also open `parametric pride rainbows.scad` in OpenSCAD and change the parameters in the customizer.

More information on how to specify the values and actually print the pins, can be found in [print-instructions.md](print-instructions.md).

#### Assembly

The pins are designed to be printed in a single piece and do not require any assembly. A "cutout"
with two knobs could be added to the back. This allows you to glue a brooch finding also known as
brooch pin and back to it.

I tried both super glue and a glue gun and both worked well. Ultimately I settled for the glue gun,
because it is faster and most likely the cheaper option.

The brooch findings I used have two holes in the base plate and I use the two knobs to properly
align them.

I've included pictures of the brooch pins I used in the `images` directory.
