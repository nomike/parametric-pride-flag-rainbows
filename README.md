A simple parametric pride flag rainbow pin generator.

It allows you to generate pins with the colors of the pride flag of your choice and the pins are designed to be printed with any single filament printer.

#### Usage

You can just run `make` to generate a default set of STL files for a number of pride flags.

If your particular flag is not on the list, ypu can also open `parametric pride rainbows.scad` in OpenSCAD and change the parameters in the customizer.

More information on how to specify the values and actually print the pins, can be found in [print-instructions.md](print-instructions.md).
